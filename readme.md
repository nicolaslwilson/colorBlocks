# Color Blocks

This was a project from my first week at Prime Digital Academy.

The assignment was to create a simple UI for appending "Color Blocks" to the DOM. For each color from a set of colors there should be a corresponding counter and button.

When the button is clicked the counter should increment by one and a block of that color is appended to the DOM. When a color block is clicked it should be removed from the DOM and the counter updated.

## Technologies Used
